    <h1> <i> Welcome to Protea Glen Youth Development Center </i></h1>
    
    <h2> Word from the Director</h2>
    <p> Protea Glen Youth Development Center was duly registered on th 12th of July 2023
        as a Non-Profit Company (NPC). the increase in demand, prompted the owners to
        look for people to assist. The further increaes in business and encouragement by
        colleagues, prompted the owners to register a legal form of business, hence the 
        birth of Protea Glen Youth Development Center.
    </p>

    <p> Our core business is to help school children with their homework, projects, assignments 
        and tutoring at Protea Glen community. Our medium to long term goal is to become a leading 
        provider capable of creating employment in Soweto and Gauteng as a whole.
